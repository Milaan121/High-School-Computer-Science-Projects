            Recognize Cyberbullying
        </h2>
        <p>
            Cyberbullying can occur through messages, email, social media, forums, or any other form of digital communication. One major clue to this is constantly receiving messages that attempt harass or humiliate the victim. The messages may slowly grow in intensity and may be public. The cyberbully may also be anonymous to cover their identity. An example of cyberbullying is receiving messages that are fake or not true and spread rumors for several weeks.

        <h2>
            Prevent Cyberbullying
        </h2>
        <p>
            To prevent cyberbullying, it is important to keep personal information private, not send mean or hurtful messages, use privacy settings, protect accounts, and recognize signs of cyberbullying. Hosting programs about cyberbullying is an efficient way to teach others about this since 4 out of 11 people do not know what cyberbullying is. Also, 3 out of 11 people would not recognize cyberbullying.
